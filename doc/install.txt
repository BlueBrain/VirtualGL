* Obtaining and Installing VirtualGL

	!!! VirtualGL must be installed on any machine that will act as a VirtualGL
	server or as a client for the [[overview.txt#VGL_Transport][VGL Transport]].
	It is not necessary to install VirtualGL on the client machine if using VNC
	or another type of X proxy.

** Installing VirtualGL on Linux

	1. Download the appropriate VirtualGL binary package(s) for your system from
		the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].
		Packages are provided for RPM-based and Debian-based Linux distributions
		that contain GLIBC 2.5 or later (including
		[[http://fedoraproject.org][Fedora]] 6 or later,
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[http://www.centos.org/][CentOS]] \
		5 or later,
		[[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] Linux Enterprise/[[http://www.opensuse.org][openSUSE]] 11 or later,
		and [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] 8.04 or later.)
		{nl}
		!!! If you want to run both 32-bit and 64-bit OpenGL applications using
		VirtualGL on 64-bit Linux systems, then you will need to install both the
		i386 and x86_64 VirtualGL RPMs or both the "virtualgl" and "virtualgl32"
		amd64 DEBs.  (The virtualgl32 DEB is a supplementary package that contains
		only the 32-bit server components.)

	2. cd to the directory where you downloaded the binary package(s), and issue
		the following commands as root:

		RPM-based systems using YUM :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -e VirtualGL --allmatches
		yum install VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

		RPM-based systems using DNF :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -e VirtualGL --allmatches
		dnf install VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

		RPM-based systems using YaST2 :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -e VirtualGL --allmatches
		yast2 --install VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

		Other RPM-based systems (dependencies will not be installed automatically) :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -e VirtualGL --allmatches
		rpm -i VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

		Debian-based systems (dependencies will not be installed automatically) :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		dpkg -i virtualgl*.deb
		---

*** Installing a 32-bit VirtualGL Package on x86-64 Linux Distributions

In order to run 32-bit OpenGL applications in VirtualGL, it is necessary to
install the 32-bit VirtualGL server components, which depend on a few 32-bit
system libraries.  Recent x86-64 Linux distributions do not include 32-bit
libraries by default, so it will be necessary to perform a few additional steps
prior to installing a 32-bit VirtualGL package on some of those distributions.

	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6+ (and work-alikes), Recent Fedora Releases, SuSE/openSUSE :: {:}

	No additional steps are necessary.
	''yum install'' / ''dnf install'' / ''yast2 --install'' takes care of all of
	the dependencies for both the 64-bit and 32-bit RPMs.

	Ubuntu 12 and later :: {:}

	Run the following command as root prior to installing the virtualgl32
	package:
	#Verb <<---
	apt-get install libxv1:i386 libglu1-mesa:i386
	---

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on OS X

	#. Download the VirtualGL Mac disk image
		(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.dmg'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open ''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.pkg'' inside the
		disk image.  Follow the instructions to install the Mac client.

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on Windows (Cygwin)

Refer to [[http://www.virtualgl.org/Documentation/Cygwin]].

** Installing VirtualGL from Source

If you are using a platform for which there is not a pre-built VirtualGL binary
package available, then download the VirtualGL source tarball
(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.tar.gz'') from the
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]],
uncompress it, ''cd VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__, and read the contents of
''BUILDING.txt'' for further instructions on how to build and install VirtualGL
from source.

** Uninstalling VirtualGL

*** Linux
#OPT: noList! plain!

As root, issue one of the following commands:

	RPM-based systems :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	rpm -e VirtualGL
	---

		!!! You may need to add ''--all-matches'' to the RPM command line if you
		have installed both the 32-bit and 64-bit VirtualGL RPMs.

	Debian-based systems :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	dpkg -r virtualgl
	---

	If you have also installed the 32-bit supplementary package:
	#Verb: <<---
	dpkg -r virtualgl32
	---

*** OS X
#OPT: noList! plain!

Use the "Uninstall VirtualGL" application provided in the VirtualGL disk image,
or issue the following command from the Terminal:
